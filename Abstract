With the growing accessibility of eye-tracking technology, researchers now have enhanced opportunities to delve deeper into the interpretive processes. These tools not only aid in understanding visual perception but also help in identifying factors that influence it, enabling researchers to make more informed decisions. In this study, an eye-tracking device called Tobii was utilized to gather data from 23 participants, aimed at developing a classification model to determine whether an individual holds a true or false memory of an event. Given the nature of the problem—a supervised learning, multi-class classification task—several widely used algorithms were employed, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The performance of each classifier was evaluated based on its accuracy score. The Random Forest algorithm yielded the highest accuracy at 68%. Precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 Score were used to assess the most accurate model, and various methods were explored to further enhance its performance.
