1. Introduction:
Due to the increasing interest in the interactions between humans and computers, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent. This is evidenced by the increasing number of studies being conducted on the development of novel AI systems that can perform various tasks at human-level. One of these is image classification, which can be performed automatically and effectively with minimal human intervention. We tend to forget about the things that we have learned and experienced because we have become so used to having all this information about ourselves. A memory is a kind of information that can be stored in an unconscious or conscious manner. This process can be described as the formation of a set of systems that can act in a cooperative manner.
Due to the complexity of the process, it can be prone to errors in the testimony that a hearing witness provides. A true memory is a type of information that can be retrieved from various sources. It can be anything that is related to a particular event, such as a visual or virtual image. People are prone to experiencing errors in their memory due to various factors. False memory is not a simple mistake, while it is common for people to mistakenly think that they have a memory error. It involves a level of certitude that the memory is still valid. Every person experiences a memory failure at some point. A false memory is different from a memory that is composed of facts that happened in the past. Instead of remembering the details of an event, a false memory focuses on the things that were never experienced.
During the 1990s, people who were going through therapy for various issues started developing false memories of violent and traumatic experiences. According to the therapists who worked with them, these individuals had been victims of childhood abuse. These memories were then produced by the individuals who were recovering from these experiences. According to psychologists, these types of memories can also be produced in real life. For instance, people might create false memories of talking about their friends on the street. However, instead of their friends' names, they talk about their acquaintances' names. A study revealed that people's memory confidence is related to their accuracy. They were more likely to retrieve false memories when they were presented with a specific theme. This suggests that people have a higher level of confidence when it comes to recalling accurate memories.
There is also evidence contradicting this idea that people with high confidence are more likely to retrieve false memories. For instance, people with high subjective confidence are more likely to report having a high accuracy when it comes to recalling false memories. When we think
